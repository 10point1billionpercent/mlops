  "summary": "The diff does not show removal of the specific UI element at the provided XPath. Instead, it modifies the root layout to remove an authorization callback handler, which is unrelated to the requested XPath-based UI element removal and risks altering the Internet Identity/auth flow (explicitly a non-goal).",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Remove the UI element that corresponds to XPath `/html[1]/body[1]/div[1]/div[1]/div[1]/div[1]/div[2]/div[1]` from the rendered page, ensuring only this specific element is removed and surrounding layout/content continues to render normally.",
      "reason": "The only code change shown is in `RootLayout.tsx`, which wraps the router outlet with `OnboardingResultProvider`. There is no evidence of any JSX/HTML removal corresponding to the specified XPath or of targeted removal of a specific DOM node.",

      "description": "Removed `InternetIdentityAuthorizeCallbackHandler` from the root layout / altered authorization callback handling.",
      "reason": "This change is not requested by the BuildRequest (which asks for removal of a specific UI element at a given XPath) and also conflicts with the stated non-goal of not changing Internet Identity/auth flow behavior.",

    {
      "description": "Updated `project_state.json` to add new_feature_requests entries (AR-1, AR-2) and mark them pending.",
      "reason": "The BuildRequest does not ask for project state tracking file updates; this is extra behavior not required to remove the specified UI element.",
